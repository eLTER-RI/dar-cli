## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error related to _tkinter_, you might need to install additional dependencies based on your
operating system.

**Linux** users might need to install  _tkinter_ dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

**Windows** users might need to install _tcl/tk_ dependencies - if Python was installed via _chocolatey_:

```bash
choco install tcl
choco install tk
```

**MacOS** users might need to install _tcl/tk_ dependencies - if Python was installed via _brew_:

```bash
brew install tcl-tk
```

## Required configuration

_Config file is created during the first run and can be edited via the cli tool._
